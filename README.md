# React Projects (Part 2)

â€¢ I took the concept of these projects (except the last one) from **freeCodeCamp**, then built them (both JS and CSS) in my own way without seeing their final files.  
â€¢ Projects article link:â€‚https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/  
â€¢ Their projects link:â€‚https://react-projects.netlify.app/  
## â€¢ **My projects link : https://hani-alhamad-react-projects-part-2.netlify.app/**  
â€¢ I used React JS (details below)* and normal CSS to build these projects.  
â€¢ I made their CSS to be compatible with mobile devices (dynamic width).  
â€¢ These files are development build, I made production builds and uploaded them to Netlify.

*hooks and other things that I used:  
-16: useState, ReactMarkDown.  
-17, 19, 20: useState & useEffect.  
-18: useState, useEffect, useFetch.  
-21: useState, useEffect, useContext, useParams, Router.  
-22: useEffect, useContext.
-23: useState, useEffect, useContext, axios.  
-used React Icons in many of them as well.   

i guess that the css blur effect made the main website abit laggy for old devices , also its JS code is a bit messy ðŸ˜…
